Go to cart folder
See the cart-item.model file

A model file usually, is created to display the fields needed for a html page. They are similar to columns in a table in SQL database.

The fields in cart-item are the ones we need to show in the cart page. 

-----------

Now go to products folder

go to product-list.component.ts file 

Can you see a method called "onAddtoCart" 
It accepts an argument myProduct of type Product
"myProduct: Product" 

Can yo u see ?

In the website, when custoemr goes to cart, they need to see the products selected on the products-list page.
But again, we do not need all product fields to show in cart.
For example: We do not need to see description or a categoryid! in cart.

And hence we created another similar class called "cart-items" with required fields

Now, in onAddtoCart method, we are updating the "cart-item" with the selected product data. 


myCartItem.id = myProduct.productId
myCartItem.name = myProduct.productName

The task is....

I am interested in seeing the image of the product too. A Small thumb-size image only. 

And for that, you must create a new field in cart-model.ts file.
call the field "imgpath" 
It is a string.

Go back to OnAddToCart method and create another line for this image path,  
myCartItem.imgpath = .... (add correct code)

Next go to cart-items.html page

Find the section where you have a loop.
Loop is given using *ngFor

It is a loop of all selected cart items
instead of {{prod.id}} , remove it and add the image code.
<img src= XXX  width="75px" height="75px" />

Enter the correct info for XXXX
